# Animal Sanctuary App

## Description
The Animal Sanctuary App is a Java-based console application designed to manage an animal sanctuary. The sanctuary starts with a few animals and allows users to interact with the sanctuary. Users can list the animals, add new animals, start the attendant's rounds to feed the animals, and quit the application.

## How to Use
- **List Animals** - Choose option 1 from the menu to list all animals in the sanctuary.
- **Add a New Animal** - Choose option 2 from the menu to add a new animal. You will be prompted to select the type of animal and provide a name.
- **Start Attendant's Rounds** - Choose option 3 from the menu to have the attendant feed the animals.
- **Quit** - Choose option 4 from the menu to exit the application.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for developing the application.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Toolset used to develop Java applications.
- **Eclipse**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and debugging Java code.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in the source code.
- **GitHub**: Platform for hosting the repository and collaborating with others.

## Lessons Learned
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Designing classes and relationships that model real-world entities.
- **Abstraction and Inheritance**: Using abstract classes and inheritance to create a hierarchy of animal types.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating animal behaviors and attributes within specific classes.
- **Debugging and Problem Solving**: Identifying and fixing issues in code to ensure correct functionality.
